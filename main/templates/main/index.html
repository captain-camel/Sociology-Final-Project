        <p>
            Gender is a SOCIAL CONSTRUCT, it is often different from a persons sex.
            <br>

        <h1 id="pronouns">Pronouns Explained</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most useful ways in making the LGBTQ+ community feel welcome is something as simple as using the pronouns that they identify with. In the English language we typically define she/her as a femine and he/him as masculine, but these pronouns are thought of as binary, fitting either male or female. If it is not clear what gender someone identifies with, it is polite to ask for their pronouns. This way, when referring to them, you can make them feel welcome. Even if you think you know, it never hurts to ask as we want to avoid mislabeling someone. A persons’ pronouns are a big part of representing who they are, so respecting them and using them appropriately is critical.
        </p>

        <h3>A breakdown of the different pronouns and how to use them</h3>
        <p>
            <b>She/her</b><br>
            → She went to the park<br>
            → I went with her<br>
            → The blue ball is hers
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>He/him</b><br>
            → He went to the park<br>
            → I went with him<br>
            → The blue ball is his            
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>They/Them</b><br>
            → They went to the park<br>
            → I went with them<br>
            → The blue ball is theirs  
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>She/They or He/They</b><br>
            → Ask the person which they prefer and use that, often they can be used interchangeably when referring to that person
        </p>
        <h3>Less Common but still used</h5>
        <p>
            <b>Ze/zir</b><br>
            → Ze went to the park<br>
            → I went with zir<br>
            → The blue ball is zirs

        <h3>
            Don’t Assume
        </h3>
        <p>
            Many people might not identify with the gender or sexual orientation that their appearence indicates. The best way to avoid offending someone and to make them feel comfortable is by asking for their pronouns and being careful not to make comments based on assumptions of their sexuality.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Take a Stand for the Community
        </h3>
        <p>
            When there are issues of LGBTQ+ rights discussed it is important that you show your support. Whether it be as simple as on social media, protesting, etc. Being there for your friends throughout their struggles is so valuable in proving you are truly on their side. In addition, correct people if you hear them using someone’s pronouns incorrectly (even if that person isn’t present) or saying discouraging jokes that could be offensive toward the LGBTQ community,  and while we are at it: avoid making any jokes that could seem targeted (even if they aren’t meant to be degrading they often can be taken this way). Another way you can take a stand is through supporting LGBTQ resources such as the organizations linked on our main page!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Make An Effort!
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you mess up someone's pronouns or say something on accident, apologize and make it clear it wasn’t intentional.  Make an effort to improve on your understanding of the LGBTQ community and your acceptance of those who belong to it. Showing that you are constantly trying to become a better ally is typically the best way to show that you truly are an ally.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Ask Questions!
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is one of the primary reasons we created this website. Asking questions is one of the most valuable ways to educate yourself. It is also important to, if you feel confused on how best to act, ask your friend. Almost everyone in the LGBTQ+ community will inform you that they would rather you ask then just make an assumption. Asking questions proves that you care and are trying to be the best, most knowledgeable friend you can be.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Be Open to Feedback
        </h3>
        <p>
            Let your friends know early on that you support them and want to be the best you can be. Ask for advice on how to better approach situations and make others feel included. When corrected or told you should change a certain thing, DO IT. Being receptive and making the changes asked of you shows that you truly want to be welcoming to them. Don’t take offense to feedback, use it as a chance to better your behavior as an Ally.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Be willing to listen and have a conversation
        </h3>
        <p>
            Once you have established that you are on their side, your friend might confide in you about different issues they face. It is so important to listen to them and validate their feelings, but avoid saying things like “I know what you are going through”. Be there as a friend and help to comfort them with what they are dealing with. Sometimes that is the best type of ally you can be: the one who won’t judge and will listen with open arms!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Recognize your own Biases and FIX THEM
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is normal to have your own opinions and biases. Our society has been pegged to make us think a certain way. However, admitting your own biases (some might even be implicit) and dedicating yourself to fixing them is crucial in becoming a better ally. No one is perfect and recognizing this then committing yourself to changing one behavior at a time can make you a better person and better Ally for the LGBTQ+ community.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Understand the adversity they face AND help them overcome it
        </h3>
        <p>
            Overtimes LGBTQ+ individuals are discriminated against in the legal system, in healthcare, in education, in the workplace, etc. Helping to stand up against this adversity through using your voice or only supporting places that promote equality are ways to show your true allyship. In addition, helping your LGBTQ+ community if they need it by donating to organizations that help them (like those listed above), giving financial support, etc. are more direct ways to help.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Don’t Be Invasive
        </h3>
        <p>
            If an individual is comfortable sharing something personal with you they will. There is no excuse for asking intrusive questions. Specifically to transgender individuals this could be little things like “what name were you born with” or bigger things like questions about their body and how they are able to do certain things. Oftentimes these topics are personal especially to someone still finding their identity. Be careful to not pry at all, just be ready to listen if the individual feels like sharing!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Keep things confidential
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes your friends might come out to you or provide you with information that they haven’t told anyone else. It is important that you ask them about what other people know in order to avoid accidentally outing them. It never hurts to ask in order to confirm that other people know their sexual orientation also. This ensures that you use the proper pronouns around people who might not know. Who they tell is their choice so it is very important to earn their trust by not telling anyone they haven’t.
        </p>

        <h1 id="guide-for-parents">A Guide for Parents of LGBTQ+ youth</h1>
        <p>
            Science explains that children usually know their gender identity by age 5. However, this is not always the case and their gender identity can change as they mature. It is important as a parent to understand how to best make your child feel supported whatever they identify with. Many kids remain in the closet for fear of how their parents will react, so from an early age here are some of the best ways to create a welcoming environment:
        </p>

        <h3>Allow them to wear what they want</h3>
        <p>
            Many children will express their gender through their clothing. By supporting your child and letting them choose what they wear, you can build a strong relationship early on. Make sure they know they are loved no matter what they wear. 
        </p>

        <h3>Educate your child</h3>
        <p>
            From an early age it is important to talk about gender constructs and make sure your child understands the basics of sexual orientations. Make sure while having these conversations you don’t tell your kid which category they are meant to fit into. Instead explain the options and make them feel comfortable to choose whatever fits them. This can also include showing them diverse media that represents varying gender identities. 
        </p>

        <h3>Don’t Put Pressure on your Child</h3>
        <p>
            Your kid will come out to you when they feel ready. Make sure that they know it is their decision and you will support them whatever they identify as. However, be sure you don’t pressure them into it. Give them space to explore and express their identity and be waiting with open arms when they choose to tell you.
        </p>

        <h3>Try to avoid categorizing items as “Feminine” or “Masculine”</h3>
        <p>
            Allow your kid to play with whatever toys they want and play whatever games make them happy. Allow your girl to play with trucks and cars, typically referred to as “boyish” items. Allow your boy to play with dolls and cooking sets, typically referred to as “girlish” items. Don’t force your child into the stereotypical gender norms. Instead, allow them to do what makes them happy and explore their identity.
        </p>

        <h3>Validate!</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure your child knows their feelings are valid. Don’t push them to be something they are not. Make sure they know that you respect their decisions. Make sure you validate what they are going through and help them through the struggles of finding their identity.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Once your kid comes out there is often confusion of how to best react. Here are the top three things to do when your kid takes that leap of faith:
        </h2>

        <h3>Support them</h3>
        <p>
            → Make sure they know you are there to help them<br>
            → Get them the resources they need<br>
            → Ask them what they need you to do
        </p>
        
        <h3>Don’t Downgrade it</h3>
        <p>
            → Don’t say you knew all along<br>
            → Don’t ignore it all together<br>
            → Don’t tell them it is probably just a phase
        </p>

        <h3>Make them feel welcomed</h3>
        <p>
            → Make sure they know that this doesn’t change your relationship<br>
            → Express how you love them no matter what<br>
            → Make sure they know that you support their decision
        </p>
